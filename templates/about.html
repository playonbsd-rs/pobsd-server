	  <h4>Game status</h4>
	  Here is the meaning of each status:
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Doesn't run:</strong> speaks for itself.</li>
	    <li><strong>Game launches:</strong> not enough information to comment meaningfully on status beyond launching the game.</li>
	    <li><strong>Major bugs:</strong> potentially game-breaking, making finishing the game impossible or a chore; noticeably degrading the enjoyment compared to running the game on other platforms.</li>
	    <li><strong>Medium impact bugs:</strong> noticeable, but not game-breaking.</li>
	    <li><strong>Minor bugs:</strong> barely noticeable, or not relevant to core game.</li>
	    <li><strong>Completable:</strong> game can be played through until the credits roll, without major bugs (category 2); doesn't (necessarily) include optional side content, DLC, optional multiplayer, achievements etc.</li>
	    <li><strong>Perfect:</strong> the complete game including optional content like DLC, side quests, multiplayer can be enjoyed.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    If you think that the status of a game is incorrect or need to be updated, please do not hesitate to report it at <a href="https://github.com/playonbsd/OpenBSD-Games-Database">https://github.com/playonbsd/OpenBSD-Games-Database</a>, at
